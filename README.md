# Node Parking

In this pair programming assignment, we use node to analyze Washington, DC parking data. Running 'node .' in the terminal results in three logs answering the following:

1. How many parking tickets were issued?
2. How many different types of parking tickets were issued?
3. What was the most common violation type for a parking ticket?

Sample data used for testing can be found in '/simple_data/parking_feb_2016.csv' with source http://opendata.dc.gov/.

This assignment makes use of the following node modules:

- csv-parse
- lodash
